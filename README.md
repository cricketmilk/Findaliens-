# FINDALIENS 🌽🛸

**The Cornfield Gazette** — aggregated reporting on aliens, drones, and unexplained phenomena, presented with a 90s space aesthetic.

Every headline links to the original third-party reporting. Headlines and summaries are written here; inclusion is not an endorsement of any claim.

## Sections

- 🚁 **Drone Watch** — airspace incidents and unidentified drone activity
- 👽 **Disclosure Desk** — government UAP file releases, hearings, and official statements
- 🌾 **Crop Circle Corner** — crop formation coverage
- 🌽 **Maizey** — a small site guide in the corner. Click her for navigation tips; each story's corn rating (🌽×1–5) indicates how contested the topic is.

## Running it

It's a static site — open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder:

```
python -m http.server 8000
```

## Unremarkable Human (merged in)

The `unremarkable-human/` folder is the old Unremarkable Human website — the
Express-based parody-site starter that preceded this gazette (See Aliens'
successor, seealiens.net being long dead). Merged here 2026-08-31 so the whole
Find Aliens lineage lives in one repo. Run it locally if you ever want it:

```
cd unremarkable-human
npm install
npm start        # Express on :3000
```

It is excluded from the Cloudflare deployment by `.assetsignore` — the live
site at findaliens.net is the static gazette in the repo root.
